                <h1>Lore</h1>
                <p>A member of the Council and the Guardian of "Civilization," a concept crafted by mankind.</p>
                <p>As a living embodiment of the sum of mankind's efforts—the mark that humans have left on the world—she is far removed from her fellow members, as well as other lifeforms. Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.</p>
                <p>She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.</p>
                <p>For some reason, she seems to project a rather pitiable aura. Perhaps this is in part thanks to the loneliness she has often felt in her perennial travels. That is what gave her the idea of making her own friend out of a material that was indispensable to the development of human civilization: paper.
                </p>
                <p>"It may fade and rip, but once a friend, forever a friend." </p>

                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Mumei is a cheerful, gentle girl who is soft-spoken and somewhat innocent, especially when compared to her peers. She's somewhat scatterbrained, and has a tendency to forget things easily.</p>
                <p>Mumei is shy and can be nervous during streams. However, she can be rather emotive, and is known for her hearty wheezing laugh, which is often heard due to her tendency to laugh at nearly anything. She often vocalizes and hums randomly, which has been compared to bird chirps or "birb noises".</p>
                <p>At debut, Hakos Baelz described Mumei as having the cutest voice in hololive -Council-, though she has also demonstrated a rather unexpectedly wide vocal range, along with a tendency to emit high-pitched screeches when surprised or agitated. Her fans and even other members of hololive, particularly Ceres Fauna, have developed some degree of protectiveness for her, due to her soft nature giving a "little sister" vibe.</p>

           <h1>Trivia</h1>
           <ul>
               <li>Both "Nanashi" and "Mumei" mean "anonymous." This refers to her canonical inability to remember her original name.</li>
               <li>Mumei reads her name in Eastern order, like Gawr Gura, Ninomae Ina'nis, Takanashi Kiara, and Ceres Fauna.</li>
               <li>Like Nanashi Mumei herself, whose names both mean "nameless," the paper bag friend has no name. Mumei never gave him a name, because she would be upset with herself if she ever forgot his name. She refers to him as "friend" because while she might forget his name, she will never forget that he is her friend.</li>
